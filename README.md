MERN Chat App
A real-time chat application made with React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Socket.IO.

Description
This is a real-time chat application that allows users to chat with each other in real-time, create groups, and have one-on-one conversations. The application is built using React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Socket.IO. Users can log in to the application, search for other users, create groups, add or remove participants, and have real-time conversations.

Features
In addition to the original features of the MERN chat app, the following features have been added:

Close/Leave Group: Users can now close or leave a group conversation. The close group feature allows the user who created the group to delete the entire conversation and remove all participants. The leave group feature allows a participant to leave the group conversation but keeps the conversation intact for the remaining participants.

Message Timestamp: Users can now hover over messages in a conversation to see the timestamp when the message was sent.
